# bwagner.org solutions
I've found the lab exercises at bwagner.org rather helpful for those who want to learn the basics of Java. I've done quite a few of these labs for a class I took, and I'd like to share my solutions for them in the event anyone would like to use them for reference. The original labs are meant to be done in Java, though I've also included a Kotlin version of each lab, and for some labs, I've included a Common Lisp rendition.

# Disclaimer
Please, for the love of Athena, **don't** use these solutions to cheat if you're using these labs in school. You hardly learn anything that way and should only use these for reference if you're absolutely stumped or just want to see how someone else did the lab for comparison. If you're really determined, I can't stop you, but don't blame me if you get caught.

# Disclaimer, part 2
I don't own the original labs. Those are the property of Mr. Barry Wagner, a computer science teacher at Denton High School, and can be found on his website, bwagner.org.
