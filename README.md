# bwagner.org solutions
I've found the lab exercises at bwagner.org rather helpful for learning the basics of Java. I've done quite a few of these labs, and I'd like to share my solutions for them in the event anyone would like to use them for reference. The original labs are meant to be done in Java, though I've also included a Kotlin version of each lab.

# Disclaimer
Please, for the love of Dracula, don't use these solutions to cheat if you're using these labs in school. You hardly learn anything that way and should only use these for reference if you're really stuck or want to see how someone else did the lab. If you're really determined, I can't stop you, but don't blame me if you get caught.
